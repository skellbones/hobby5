     <p> chess is a very challanging game but its easy and fun to start, chess was invented a long time ago in india where it was very similar to the chess today yet some aspects have changed, for example there were no queens and the knights were replaced with elephants. after its long history in asia if arrived in europe but it still wasnt the same, it had a relativaly weak peice called the advisor which did nothing but move like the king and se a sort of bodygaurd, it was later replaced by the stronger queen that we know today probably inspired by the then recent surge of strong female leaders. then came the cold war where the russians would make sort of "chess supersoilders" who were the best of the best in their game, that is until they were beaten by am IBM computer named "deep blue." chess playing computers had been developed for years but deep blues win over soviet chess master garry kasparov was the first time a computer program has beat a reigning champion at chess, and they have consistantly beat their creator race at chess. but like the game they have mastered they were built from human enginuity, and its human enginuity that will lead us to beat the machines. </p>
